          What is generative artificial intelligence(AI)? <br /><br />
          Generative AI is essentially a type of artificial intelligence that is
          trained on things such books, research papers, videos, and other
          information, which results in the AI being able to generate text,
          video, or sound.
          <br /><br />
          Why is it concerning?
          <br /><br />
          Many people are concerned about the usage of generative AI;
          particularly, creatives such as writers, graphic designers, and others
          working in similar fields share the concern that generative AI may
          take their jobs. In Minnesota, there are roughly 50,000 people working
          in the art and entertainment industry, and many of their jobs are
          affected by the prevalence of generative AI(Current Employment
          Statistics (CES) 2025). The largest example of these concerns boiling
          over is the 2023 Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, where writers
          struck for months over these very concerns.

        <p>
          Eventually, the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
          Producers, whom the WGA were striking against, were able to come to an
          agreement that outlined the following rules:<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            “Neither traditional AI (technologies including those used in CGI
            and VFX) nor generative AI (GAI, meaning artificial intelligence
            that produces content including written material) is a writer, so no
            written material produced by traditional AI or GAI can be considered
            literary material.”
          </li>
          <li>
            “If a company gives a writer written material produced by GAI that
            hasn’t been previously published or exploited, that material doesn’t
            count as assigned material (for compensation purposes) or source
            material (for determining credits), and can’t be used to disqualify
            a writer for separated rights. In other words, a company can’t give
            you an AI-generated screenplay and pay you a rewrite fee—you would
            be treated as the first writer of the screenplay.”
          </li>
          <li>
            “A writer can choose to use AI when performing writing services if
            the company consents and the writer follows any applicable company
            policies. But the company can’t require the writer to use AI
            software (e.g., ChatGPT) when performing writing services.”
          </li>
          <li>
            “The Company must disclose to the writer if any materials given to
            the writer have been generated by AI or incorporate AI-generated
            material. The WGA reserves the right to assert that exploitation of
            writers’ material to train AI is prohibited by MBA or other law.”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Artificial Intelligence 2025)</p>
        <p>While agreements like this one are a step forward, the laws in the United States that deal with the use of generative AI are still lacking.</p>
